# AI Toolkit Web Application

This project contains a containerized web application for interacting with and managing local Large Language Models (LLMs). It features a dashboard for chatting with models and a code generation tool with a live preview.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## How to Run

The following instructions explain how to get the application running. The core `docker-compose` commands are the same across platforms, but the terminal setup may differ.

### With Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS)

1.  **Open your terminal:**
    - On **Windows**, open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
    - On **macOS**, open the Terminal app.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    Use the `cd` command to change to the folder where you cloned this repository.
    ```sh
    cd path/to/ai-toolkit
    ```

3.  **Start the application:**
    Run the following command to build the Docker images and start all services.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    You will see logs from all services in this terminal window.

4.  **Download a model:**
    Open a **second, new terminal window** and navigate to the same project directory. Run the `exec` command to get a shell inside the Ollama container and pull a model.
    ```sh
    docker-compose exec ollama ollama run llama3:8b
    ```
    This will download the `llama3:8b` model. You can replace this with any other model from the [Ollama library](https://ollama.com/library).

5.  **Access the Dashboard:**
    Once the model is downloaded, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The new model should appear in the "Select Active Model" dropdown.

### With WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you have Docker Desktop installed with the WSL 2 backend, you can run all commands from your WSL terminal.

1.  **Open your WSL terminal** (e.g., Ubuntu).

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    Your Windows file system is typically mounted under `/mnt/`. For example:
    ```sh
    cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/path/to/ai-toolkit
    ```

3.  **Start the application:**
    The command is the same as above.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Download a model:**
    Open a **new WSL terminal tab or window**, navigate to the same project directory, and run:
    ```sh
    docker-compose exec ollama ollama run llama3:8b
    ```

5.  **Access the Dashboard:**
    Open your web browser on Windows and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
